<h2><b>Submit an INTRA CV</b></h2>

Please firstly read the INTRA CV Guidelines document at:
http://www101.dcu.ie/internal/intra/INTRA_Student_CV_Guidelines.pdf

Please click "Compose CV" fill out the form with all the relevant details and click the submit button once you are finished.
To jump from field to field, press the Tab key. Pressing the enter/return key will try and submit the CV.

Please click "save & exit" every 5 minutes to avoid losing information.

After you have submitted your CV the INTRA office will check through it. If it requires revision, you will be notified (usually sometime after the CV submission deadline) and you will see instructions on the changes required. You should then submit your CV again when you have made the changes.
</p>
<h2>Job Applications</h2>
<p>
After successfully submitting your CV it is time for you to take a look at the Job offers available to your class. On the main page the will be a message telling you of job offer to which you can apply. Click the button to be brought to the list of job offers.

To view a job description, simply click on the title of the job. A new page will load up with the name of the company, its location and a brief job description. There may be a link to the company's own online application process, which you should follow.

To apply for the job (and we suggest you apply for ALL opportunities) simply click the Apply button. This will add your name to the list of students who wish to apply for the job. After the application deadline has been reached you will no longer be able to apply for the vacancy, so make sure you login regularly to check the latest offers.

Following the deadline date, the INTRA office will review the list of students who have applied and CVs will be forwarded (either all, or a shortlist depending on the company's instructions) for consideration. The company will review your CV online and decide whether or not to call you for interview.
</p>
<h2>Interviews</h2>
<p>
If you get selected for interview with a company you will be notified via a message on your main page when you log in. The message will give you the date, time, location and interviewer name(s) and you will be asked to confirm you have seen the details by clicking the confirm button.
</p>
<h2>Successful Application</h2>
<p>

You may go through the process of applying for jobs a few times before you are successful. Simply follow the above steps as necessary. Once you are successful in your application for a job you will see a note informing you that you have been hired by a specific company. You will then be locked out of the system and no longer be able to apply for positions. You will still be able to view the job description for which you were successful.
